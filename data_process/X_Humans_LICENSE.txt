This prohibition includes using the DATASET for the partial or total training of neural networks or other artificial intelligence systems for commercial use. Using the provided DATASET to promote a commercial entity or product or in any other manner that directly or indirectly results in commercial gains is strictly prohibited.

4. Any use of the DATASET beyond non-commercial academic purposes is expressly prohibited, including, but not limited to, its use for identity recognition; for visual surveillance; to create “deep-fakes” or other misleading or deceptive content; or to create pornography or other inappropriate content. The USER shall further not carry out any procedures with the DATASET (linking, comparison, processing) with which any identity of a person could be derived.

In addition, upon the first request by ETH Zurich, the right to use the DATASET will end immediately, and the USER will destroy any DATASET copy they may have and confirm the deletion to ETH Zurich.

6. The DATASET is provided “as is” without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
